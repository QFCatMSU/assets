## What is RevealJS

RevealJS is a system for developing web-based presentation documents, similar to PowerPoint. This tutorial assume that you want to create multiple documents inside a project (e.g., multiple lessons in a class repository).

## YAML

Create a ***\_quarto.yml*** file ([note: the filename starts with an underscore]{.note}) in the root of your project folder and add the following:

``` yaml
title: Put the title of your class
date-format: "D MMMM YYYY"

title-slide-attributes:
    data-background-image: "https://qfcatmsu.github.io/assets/images/qfc_logo.png"
    data-background-size: "40%"
    data-background-position: "6% 95%"
format: 
  revealjs:
    css: "https://qfcatmsu.github.io/assets/quarto/qfc_pres_styles.css"
    slide-number: c/t  
    theme: simple 
    include-in-header:
      - text: |
          <link rel = "shortcut icon" href = "https://qfcatmsu.github.io/assets/images/qfc_icon.png" />
          <script src="https://qfcatmsu.github.io/assets/quarto/qfc_pres_styles.js"></script>
editor: visual
highlight-style: kate
```

The YAML above will be applied to all Quarto revealjs documents in your repository
