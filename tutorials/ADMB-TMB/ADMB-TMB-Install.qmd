[Note: Mac installation of this software is much more involved – contact Charlie for instructions.]{.note}

 

[The project is maintained on Github](https://github.com/QFCatMSU/ADMB-TMB-Install). 

## Overview

These procedures in the document install the following software and was tested on [5/20/2025]{.hl}:

-   R 4.5.0

-   Rtools 45 (for the CPP compilers)

-   RStudio 2025.05.0 Build 496

-   TMB package for R 1.9.17

-   ADMB 13.1

-   Emacs 27.2 ([Emacs versions 28 and up will not work]{.hl})

-   Emacs configuration files

    -   These files provide the syntax highlighting in Emacs for both ADMB and TMB and set up the Environment

-   admb2r.cpp in the ADMB folder

 

[Appendix 1: User Environment PATH]

### Admin access to your computer

The installation procedures will do the following that[might require more administrative access]{.hl} to your computer than your user account has:

-   Install programs (R, RStudio, Rtools, ADMB, Emacs)

-   Install programs directly to the **C:** drive (ADMB, RTools)

-   Install programs not validated by Microsoft (ADMB)

-   Run a batch file (PATH.bat)

## Viewing hidden files and extensions in Windows (optional)

This section is useful for this installation and for any programming you do on your computer.

## Software Installation

[You can use the default installation options for all applications.]{.hl}

 

Steps 1-4 are only needed for TMB, step 5 is only needed for ADMB, steps 6 and 7 are needed for both ADMB and TMB.

1\) [Download](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) and Install R (you need to have at least version 4.3)

 

2\) [Download](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) and install Rtools (you need to have at least version 43 and the version must match your R version)

-   Click on ***Rrools4X Installer*** in ***Installing Rtools4X*** section

 

3\) [Download](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiW0dHZ7Yn_AhV9jokEHRZAB9kQFnoECBMQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fposit.co%2Fdownload%2Frstudio-desktop%2F&usg=AOvVaw00E_pTzIH4wAv6GUeuh7hj) and install RStudio (you need to have a version from 2022 or later)

 

4\) Open RStudio and install the TMB package

-   In RStudio: ***Tools*** ➔ ***Install Packages***… ➔ type ***TMB*** in ***Packages*** textbox ➔ ***Install***

-   [Close RStudio]{.hl} after installing package

 

5\) [Download](http://www.admb-project.org/downloads/admb-13.1/QuickStartWindows.html) and install ***ADMB-13.1-windows.exe***

-   [Alternatively, you can [download](http://www.admb-project.org/downloads/admb-12.3/) ***ADMB-12.3-windows.exe***]{.note} (under ***Windows*** header)

-   When installing, you will likely get a ***Windows protected your PC*** screen, if so:

    -   click ***More info***

    -   click ***Run anyway***

 

6\) [Download](http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/emacs/windows/emacs-27) and install ***emacs-27.2-x86_64-installer.exe***

 

7\) [Go to ADMB-TMB-Install GitHub page](https://github.com/QFCatMSU/ADMB-TMB-Install)

-   Click on green ***Code*** button and choose ***Download Zip***

    -   This will download a zipped file named ***ADMB-TMB-Install-main.zip***

-   Unzip ***ADMB-TMB-Install-main.zip*** (right-click, ***Extract All*** then ***Extract***). 

-   Execute (double-click) ***Path.bat***

    -   You will likely get a ***Windows protected your PC*** screen, if so:

        1.  click ***More info***

        2.  click ***Run anyway***

-   If this does not work you can do this: [Appendix 2: manually copy configuration files and admb2r.cpp] (this link also includes more about the files)

 

8\) Restart computer

-   As far as I know, this step is not needed -- but I keep it here just to be safe.

## Have Emacs open TPL files by default (optional)

-   Right-click on any ***\*.tpl*** file

    -   there is one in the folder you just extracted ***➔*** ***examples ➔ simple ➔ simple.tpl***

-   Choose ***Open With***

-   **Windows 10:**

    -   At bottom, click ***Choose an app on your PC***

    -   The Path is: **C:\\Program Files\\Emacs\\x86_64\\bin\\runemacs.exe**

    -   Click ***Open***

    -   Click ***Always***

-   **Windows 11:**

    -   go to bottom and click on ***Choose another***

    -   At bottom, click ***Choose an app on your PC***

    -   The Path is: ***C:\\Program Files\\Emacs\\x86_64\\bin\\runemacs.exe***

    -   Click ***OK***

 

[Note: the same procedures will work if you want emacs to be the default program for CPP files]{.note}

## Testing out ADMB

-   In folder you just unzipped, double-click ***emacs ➔ examples*** ***➔ simple*** ***➔ simple.tpl***

-   Open ***simple.tpl*** in ***Emacs***

-   Click ***Translate*** (button 1), ***Build*** (button 2), and ***Run*** (button 3)

    -   Make sure you wait for steps to complete

-   If the Emacs panels look like this after ***Run,*** then ADMB is properly installed:

![Translate, Build, and Run buttons in ADMB.  This view is from ADMB 12.3 -- the view from 13.1 is slightly different](images/clipboard-2143533352.png){#fig-testADMB .fs}

## Testing out TMB

-   In folder you just unzipped, double-click ***emacs ➔ examples ➔ mini ➔ mini.cpp***

-   Open ***mini.cpp*** in ***Emacs***

-   Click ***Clean*** (button 1), ***Compile*** (button 2), and ***Run*** (button 3)

    -   Make sure you wait for each step to complete

    -   ***Compile*** take a minute or two

-   If the Emacs panels look like this after ***Run,*** then TMB is properly installed:

![Clean, Compile, and Run buttons in TMB](images/clipboard-3450310665.png){#fig-testTMB .fs}

### Package inconsistency error

If you see this message when compiling a TMB program:

``` bash
Warning message:
In checkMatrixPackageVersion() : Package version inconsistency detected.
TMB was built with «Matrix version 1.5.4.1»
Current «Matrix version is 1.5.4»
Please re-install 'TMB' from source using install.packages('TMB', type = 'source') or ask CRAN for a binary version of 'TMB' matching CRAN's 'Matrix' package
using C++ compiler: 'G__~1.EXE (GCC) 12.2.0'
```

Do not follow the instructions given.  Instead just update or reinstall the outdated package (in this case, ***Matrix***).  This is only necessary if the the script does not work because of the outdated package.

## Appendix 1: User Environment PATH

The User Environment PATH variable is not needed anymore.  I added this to the emacs configuration files.

 

However, there is still a chance that the User Environment PATH has been set by a previously installed program and that PATH could interfere with ADMB and TMB's operation.  This is most likely only going to be true if you previously installed ADStudio.

 

You can see the User Environment PATH by doing a Windows search for ***Environment*** and choosing ***Edit the system environment variables***.

 

That will open the ***System Properties*** window on the ***Advanced*** tab-- click on the ***Environment...*** button:

![The Advanced System Properties tab](images/clipboard-3325142985.png){#fig-AdvSysProp .fs}

Then double-click on ***Path*** in the ***User variables*** section:

![Path variables](images/clipboard-644731793.png){#fig-PathVars .fs}

Delete any references to older versions of ADMB, TMB, or ADStudio.  You can also safely delete the references to the current ADMB version -- they are not needed.

## Appendix 2: manually copy configuration files and admb2r.cpp

The extracted folder ***ADMB-TMB-Install-main*** contains:

-   An executable file called ***PATH.bat*** (which installs the folders and files below)

-   A folder called ***emacsConfigFiles*** that gets installed to the emacs folder when ***PATH.bat*** is executed

-   A folder called ***Examples***, which contains ADMB and TMB scripts that are used in this document to test the installation.

-   ***admb2r.cpp*** -- a commonly used ADMB script file that is not included with ADMB

 

***PATH.bat*** is a batch file that copies the emacs configuration files and ***admb2r.cpp*** to the correct locations.

 

The following are instructions to manually copy the files -- [this is only needed if PATH.bat does not work]{.hl}.

### Copy emacs configuration files

Inside ***ADMB-TMB-Install-main***, there is a folder named ***emacsConfigFiles***.  You need to copy the contents inside the ***emacsConfigFiles*** folder (a file named ***.emacs*** and a folder named ***emacs***) to the user’s ***appdata*** folder.

 

The easiest way to get to the user's ***appdata*** folder is to type **%appdata%** in a File Explorer window and hit enter.  Or, you can go directly to the folder: ***C:\\Users\\\<yourUserName\>\\AppData\\Roaming***.  Move both the ***emacs*** folder and ***.emacs*** file to this folder:

![Location to copy the emacs configuration files](images/clipboard-3668966338.png){#fig-PathFiles .fs}

### Copy admb2r.cpp

The file ***admb2r.cpp*** is used in ADMB scripts but it does not come with ADMB.

 

You can add it to ADMB by copying ***admb2r.cpp*** from the ***ADMB-TMB-Install-main*** folder to the following locations:

-   **c:\\ADMB-13.1\\include**

-   **c:\\ADMB-13.1\\include\\contrib**  (I am not sure it is necessary to copy it here)

 

[Note: If you are using a different version of ADMB then replace **13.1** with the version you are using]{.note}
