Modifying a table in Quarto Visual mode

For all modification, you need to put the table inside a Div 
- Format -> Div (or Insert -> Div)
- it is easiest to create the div first and the table within
- you can also create the div outside the table and cut/paste the div in

To make the table width the size of content:
- Add class "fit" to the Div

To make the table linkable:
- Add id="tbl-anyThingGoesHere" to the Div

To add a Title to the table (this also numbers the table):
- Put text inside the Div under the table
- Note: only do one line of text

To add a caption under the table:
- Add text directly under the Div (not inside) 
- Surrond text with a Span (format -> Span)
- add class = "table-caption" to the Span
