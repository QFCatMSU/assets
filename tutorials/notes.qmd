Push and Pull only operate on the branch you are currently working on

Detached Head: when the Head is not pointing to the end of a branch

refs: list all head/master

origin: remote repository (as of last Pull)

HEAD: point to the currently checked out branch -- usually the end unless the head is detached

\- can have multiple (worktree) -- this is advanced!

master: end of main branch

\<name of branch\> - end of another branch

origin/master - end of remote master branch

origin/\<name of branch\> - end of another remote branch

Note: origin is the name typically used for the remote repo -- it does not have to be that name

origin/HEAD - remote checkedout branch

HEAD -\> refs/head/master (similar to folder linking?)
