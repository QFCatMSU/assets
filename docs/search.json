R is a programming language and RStudio provides a structured environment for the R programming language, similar to the way Microsoft Word provides a structured environment for document editing. RStudio is patterned on other popular programming environments like Microsoft’s Visual Studio.\n \nOn Windows the default installation can be used for R and RStudio. For Mac, installation is trickier.\n\n4.1 Install or update R (need version 4.4 or higher)\nThe R for Windows download is here. Click on Download R 4.#.# for Windows.\n \nThe R for Mac download is here.  \n\nThere are two versions of R for Mac \n\nR-4.#.#-arm64.pkg: for Macs with Apple-based processors (M1, M2, M3…), all Macs from 2021 on use Apple-based processors\nR-4.#.#.pkg: for older Macs with Intel-based processors\n\nThe installer will tell you If you pick the wrong pkg file – there is no harm except a bit of wasted time.\n\n \nAnd for those of you using Linux – the R for Linux download instructions are here.\n\n\n4.2 Install or update RStudio\nYou need version 2023.12 or higher for this class and you should have 2025.04 or higher if you are using Git.\n \nYou can download the RStudio Installer here. Download the appropriate file for your computer under Installers, open the file, and use the default installation options.\n\n4.2.1 Special instructions for Mac users\nFor Mac users there are some extra complexities:\n\nYou might be asked to install Command Line Developer Tools while installing RStudio. Go ahead and install the developer tools.\n \nThe download for RStudio is called RStudio-202X.XX.dmg.  Double-clicking the file will open the window below (Figure 4).  In the window, drag the RStudio file to the Applications folder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Opening RStudio DMG file\n\n\n\nIf you already have RStudio installed, you will be asked if you want to replace the old version – go ahead and Replace it.\n \n\nAfter installation, unmount the RStudio device in the Finder by clicking the eject button (Figure 5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Unmounting the RStudio device (very important!)"

    "text": "6 RStudio Projects and Project Folders\nMost of the work you do in R involves scripts, data files, and other types of files (e.g., shapefiles).  All these files together make up your project and they exist within a Project Folder, which is the folder on your computer that contains all the files and subfolders for your project. It is very important that you keep all files associated with a project within a Project Folder.\n \nIn this class we will be using RStudio to create, edit, and execute R scripts.  In RStudio, there is a feature called RStudio Projects, which is a Project Folder, that makes it much easier to move, share, and host your project on GitHub.  You need to keep all of your class work in an RStudio Project.\n\n6.1 Create a new RStudio Project\nTo create a new RStudio Project, which is also your project folder:\n\nopen RStudio\nclick File -&gt; New Project \nIn the Create Project window click New Directory\nIn the Project Type window click New Project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Creating a new RStudio Project\n\n\n\n \nIn the Create New Project window:\n\nThe Directory name is the name of the Project Folder that will contain your whole RStudio Project\nThe Project Folder will be created in the folder listed in the second textbox (Create project as subdirectory of:)\n\n \nIn Figure 8, the Project Folder is named My_Project and is in the Desktop folder.  Note: you can name the folder whatever you want and put it in any folder location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Creating a directory for the RStudio Project\n\n\n\n \nExtension: RStudio Project in an existing directory\n\n\n6.2 RStudio Project Files Tab\nThe Files tab (bottom-right corner) in RStudio is a File Manager, and it allows you to do many things that you can do in your operating systems File Manager (called File Explorer in Windows and Finder in Mac). The Files tab can be used to open, add, remove, or rename files and folders. When we first create the RStudio Project, the Files tab will be set to the Project Folder (Figure 9, C:/Users/Charlie/Desktop/My_Project) and there is one file in the folder: My_Project.Rproj.\n \nWhenever you create an RStudio Project, an .Rproj file is added to the Project Folder. This main purpose of this file is to designate this folder as the working directory for your project.  Double-clicking on the .Rproj file in your File Manager will open your Project in RStudio (just like double-clicking a .docx file opens the file in Word).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Files tab opened to the Project Folder\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3 Viewing hidden files in RStudio\nBy default, the Files tab shows file extension but it does not show hidden files.  If you click on More -&gt; Show Hidden Files, you will see the hidden folder .Rproj.user – this is not a folder you will use in this class.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Showing hidden files\n\n\n\nExtension: *.RProj and .Rhistory\n\n\n6.4 Add Subfolders\nWe will use the Files tab in RStudio (bottom-right tab) to create two subfolders: scripts and data.\n \nTo add two folders named scripts and data:\n\nClick on New Folder in the Files tab\nEnter scripts in the textbox and click OK\nRepeat the last two steps to add a folder called data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Adding folders using the Files tab in RStudio\n\n\n\n\n\n6.5 Add files to the project\nWe are going to download two files and add them to your new RStudio Project.\n\nRSProj_Setup.r: put this file in your scripts directory\nRSProj_Setup.csv: put this file in your data directory\n\n\n\n6.6 Opening File Manager from Files tab\nThe Files tab can do a lot of things that File Explorer/Finder can do – but not everything.  For instance, you cannot drag and drop files in the Files tab like you can in File Explorer/Finder.\n \nYou can open up a File Explorer/Finder window to the same folder by clicking More… -&gt; Show Folder in New Window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: The Files tab in RStudio and the File Manager\n\n\n\n\n\n6.7 RStudio Project File Manager\nYou should now be running RStudio, opened to the RStudio Project that you just created.  If you click on the Files tab in the lower-right corner, you will see all the folders and files within your RStudio Project (linked to your Project Folder). You will also see your project name in the upper-right corner (in this case, My_Project).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: RStudio opened with an RStudio Project (named My_Project)\n\n\n\nThe *.RProj files is here and you might also see a file named .RHistory. These are not files you will need to use right away but you can learn more about them at Extension: *.RProj and .Rhistory."

If you are taking the GGPlot class, the code in RSProj_Setup.R is something you will learn throughout the course.\n\n7.1 Open your RStudio Project\nThere are multiple ways to open an RStudio Project – three of them are:\n\nOpen your Project Folder in File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac) window and double-click the &lt;Project_Name&gt;.Rproj file\nIn RStudio, click File -&gt; Open Project… -&gt; navigate to the Project Folder and click the *&lt;Project_Name&gt;.Rproj file\nIn RStudio, click File -&gt; Recent Projects -&gt; choose the RStudio Project you just created\n\n\n\n7.2 Open a script file in your Project\nTo open the script file either:\n\nIn Files tab, go to the scripts folder and click on RSProj_Setup.R or\nIn RStudio click File -&gt; Open File -&gt; and then find  RSProj_Setup.R in the scripts folder and click Open.\n\n \nAfter opening the script file, you should see something that looks like this (Figure 14) on your screen:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Opening your first script in RStudio\n\n\n\nThe script will only execute if it is opened inside your RStudio Project.\n\n\n7.3 Setting up RStudio tabs for scripts\nWhen we are editing and executing an R script, we generally have the following RStudio tabs open (Figure 15):\n\nFile Viewer – text viewer and editor for the opened script files (upper-left corner)\nConsole – displays information about the execution of your script file (lower-left corner)\nEnvironment – displays data points, or variables, from the execution of your script file (upper-right corner)\nPlots – plots produced by the execution of your script file are displayed here (lower-right corner)\n\n \nThe fourth (lower-right corner) tab is on Files, so we switched the tab to Plots:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: The Tabs most commonly used in RStudio\n\n\n\n \nNote: the Help tab in the lower-right corner is something you might find useful. Extension: The Help Tab\n\n\n7.4 Common buttons used in RStudio\nThe script file, RSProj_Setup.r, is a fully functioning script that takes temperature and wind data from the Comma Separated Value (CSV) file, RSProj_Setup.csv, and plots out the data. I am going to use this program to demonstrate a few of the useful buttons in RStudio.\n \nThe one button you will use most in R is Source, which executes your whole script.  Press the Source button to execute the script (Figure 16).\n \nNote: If you have already used R, there is a good chance you highlight lines of code and click Run to execute just those lines.  We are not using this method in this class.  For this class, you should always use Source to execute your code.  For more information go to Extension: Run vs. Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Running (Sourcing) the script\n\n\n\nAfter the script is run:\n\nThe Environment tab displays values for the data (variables) in the script (e.g., weatherData, windLabels).\nThe Console tab displays information about the execution of the script.\nThe Plot tab displays the box plots.  If there are multiple plots, you can use the arrow buttons to switch between the plots.\n\n\n\n7.5 Cleaning up the RStudio windows\nThere many times where you want to clean up the windows, which can get very crowded with information from old script executions.\n\nTo clean the Environment, Plot, and Console tabs use the brush button (Figure 16).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17: Cleaning out the windows\n\n\n\n \nIf you click Source again, the Environment, Plot, and Console tabs will once again be populated with data from the script."

    "section": "12 Extension: Working directories in R and RStudio (why RStudio Projects)",
    "text": "12 Extension: Working directories in R and RStudio (why RStudio Projects)\nThis topic is, in this author’s opinion, one of the most frustrating topic in R.  Compared to other programming languages (e.g., C++. Python, Javascript), R handling of working directories makes it harderto share projects.\n \nA working directory is the folder location used when one file is looking for another file.  It is best shown by its use-case: a script file that is reading in information from another file – this file can be a data file or another script file.\n \nFor example, let’s say we have a script file called weather.r and it is pulling in data from the file weather2020.csv.  weather.r needs to first find the folder location for weather2020.csv before it can access the file.  To do this, weather.r needs a path to weather2020.csv.  This path can be thought of as map directions between two points – and the working directory is the starting point.\n \nFor the vast majority of programming languages, there is no concept of a working directory.  The process of files calling other files works like google maps – a route is specified between the two files starting with the folder the caller (e.g., weather.r) is in and ending where the callee (e.g., weather.csv) is. The path between the two files is called a relative file path. \n\n12.1 R’s default handling of working directories\nIn R, the starting point, or working directory, is fixed for all R files opened in a session (called a session variable).  Using the google maps analogy, this is like saying the map starting point is fixed for everyone – it does not matter where you actually are located.  You can change the working directory in your script using setwd() but this changes the working directories for all R files in the session.  In other words, you are simply changing the starting point to a new location and all files will now use that location.\n\n\n12.2 Absolute file paths (a bad fix to the problem)\nOne way to get around working directories is to use an absolute file path.  So, instead of mapping between weather.R and weather.csv, you just give the file path for weather.csv on your computer (called the absolute file path).\n \nThis will look something like: c:\\Users\\RStudent\\Documents\\WeatherProj\\Data\\weather.csv\n \nDoing this means you do not have to worry about working directories.  But this solution breaks as soon as you move files on your computer or move them to another computer.  The reason is that the file path changes.  Absolute file paths make it almost impossible to share file and should not be used.\n\n\n12.3 How RStudio Projects handle working directory (the least-worst option)\nAn RStudio Project sets the working directory to the Project Folder.  So, for weather.r to find weather.csv inside an RStudio Project, it just needs to know where weather.csv is located relative to the project folder.  Most likely this will be something like: Data\\weather.csv. This makes it far easier to share your project because the path to weather.csv will be the same on any computer.\nWhile I believe this is by far the best method for handling working directory issues, it comes with a major caveat:You need to open script files from within the RStudio Project.  Opening the project sets the working directory for all script files used in the session.  If you a file outside of the Project session, then the working directory is not set by the project.\n\n\n12.4 The default working directory\nA working directory is not defined for a file, it is defined for a session.  So, all files within that session will have the same working directory.  IF you change the working directory in one file, you change it for every file within the session.  This leads to awkward behavior where one R file can change the behavior of another R file within the same session by using setwd()."

The script files would contain multiple lines of code that could be execute independently and in any order (think of these as buttons on a calculator).  The user could click a “button” to pull in data, click another “button” to run statistical analysis on the data, and click a third “button” to output the analysis.  This is what the Run button does.\n \nHowever, as R has grown, the focus has shifted towards developing well-structured code just like any modern programming language (e.g., Python, C, Java). This means executing the script as a whole instead of in parts.  This is what Source does.  Executing your script as a whole instead of in parts has many advantages as the code is easier to debug, easier to share, and much better organized – because you are forced to organize it. In the not-so-humble opinion of this author, learning to treat your script as a whole is a vital part of learning how to program.  For this reason, we will always be using the Source button in this class."

In an RStudio Project, this is easy because the working directory is always the Project Folder of your project – and all files in the project are contained within the Project Folder.  So, you just need to look for the file relative to the Project Folder.\n \nR Programmers often get around the lack of a Project Folder/defined working directory by setting the working directory in code using setwd().  This can work locally but becomes problematic when files are shared or moved.  Whereas, RStudio Project always maintain their folder structure."
