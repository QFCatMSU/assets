For this class, it is OK to just use a free account. Educators, students, and non-profit workers can get a professional account for free.\n\n\nCreating a GitHub repository\nWhen logged in to GitHub (fig ##):\n\nClick on the + at the top-right and choose New Repository\nChoose a repository name\nChoose whether you want the repository to be Public or Private (this can be changed later)\n\nPublic means that anyone with the repository link can view (but not edit) your files\nPrivate means that only users you add in Settings -&gt; Manage Access can view the repository (more in Inviting users to your repository)\n\nClick Create Repository\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Creating a new repository in GitHub\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting the URL for the repository\nTo link a Git repository with this GitHub repository, you will need the URL for the GitHub repository. After you create the new repository, a window will appear (fig ##) with the URL at the top in the Quick Setup section. Copy this URL and save it – you will use it in the next section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: The URL for the GitHub repository you just created\n\n\n\n\n\nGitHub repository format\nIf you lose the Quick Setup page then the URL is going to be the part of the URL circled below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: The URL for your GitHub repository\n\n\n\nThe GitHub repository link is the URL that takes you directory to the online project.  A GitHub repository link is always in this format:\nhttps://github.com/&lt;github_user_or_team_name&gt;/&lt;github_repository_name&gt;.git\nSo, if my GitHub username is QFCatMSU and my repository name is gitHubTest then the link is (yes, this repository exists):\nhttps://github.com/qfcatmsu/githubtest.git\nNotes: .git is optional and capital/lowercase does not matter",
